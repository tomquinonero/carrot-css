    <h1>Carrot CSS</h1>
<p>A cool and small CSS starter that gets you on going fast and right.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Carrot CSS is a small starter library for your projects. It contains the minimum you need to start a project.</p>
<p>This library should be used by people that actually intend to write CSS, as it is not a component library, does not offers much styling and is not an utility library.
This is not meant to stops you from writing CSS, but to start your CSS from a right basis.</p>
<p>It is not meant to be a component library neither. Just some default style, some wwisely named design tokens and few cool classes.</p>
<h2>What's inside ?</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Just the minimum needed to have decent readability and nice contrast between title sizes and paragraphs.</p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>These helps you going faster. Great layout utilities from <a href="https://every-layout.dev/">Every Layout</a> will help reduce these <code>display: flex</code> and keep the layout DRYer. Some form fields and buttons classes to get you going and few utilities.</p>
<h3>Theming &amp; Customization</h3>
<p>We use CSS Variables to store palette color from <em>tailwind</em>, because they are nice. .</p>
<p>But we love how the design tokens gives you felxibility so we are <em>not</em> using these palette c olors directly in the CSS, but rather from the <strong>Design Tokens</strong> defined in the theme file.
A <strong>theme</strong> is a <em>group of CSS variables</em> that defines colors for the application.
The tokens that are not related to colors exists also as CSS variables.
To configure the tokens, you can use our <a href="#">Variables template</a> that you can use to overwrite variables.</p>
