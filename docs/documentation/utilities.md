# Utilities

Carrot CSS provides you with a bunch of utility classes, _shadow_ for boxes and text, _font sizes_ and few text utilities.
We do not provide more of them _on purpose_, as this is not the goal of the library. We want to stick to the minimum there.

## Font Sizes

Classes from `.font-size-300` to `.font-size-900` are provided to apply these font sizes.

## Shadows

Shadows for box `shadow-small`, `shadow-medium`, `shadow-large` and `shadow-extra-large` are provided.
They also exist for text: `shadow-text-small`, `shadow-text-medium`, `shadow-text-large` and `shadow-text-extra-large`.

## Others

- `nowrap`: apply `white-space: nowrap;`
- `truncate`: makes the text truncable and overflow with `text-overflow: ellipsis;`
- `uppercase`: make the text uppercase
