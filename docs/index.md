# Tips and notes about freelancing

It‚Äôs rolling onto 2 years since I went back independent and fully freelance,
but over the 11+ years I‚Äôve been working in design and the web, I‚Äôve probably
done around half of that as a freelancer in some capacity. Lots of people are
experiencing either redundancies or work issues at the moment and although, at
the time of writing, we are in a global pandemic: now is a great time to go
freelance. In this article, I‚Äôm going to share with you some tips that have
helped me make a success out of this freelancing stuff. I hope by the end that
you will feel more confident about going freelance. I must point out that the
advice is mainly centered around working with clients, rather than say, doing
contract development work, but hopefully you‚Äôll get some benefit if that‚Äôs
you. Let‚Äôs dig in.

## Freedom The ‚ÄúF‚Äù in Freelance stands for ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù.

It doesn‚Äôt really, but freedom is exactly what you get when you go freelance.
This freedom for me has enabled two key things: ownership of my time and
flexibility to diversify what I do. I went back to freelancing in September
2018 after being made redundant from an agency. For at least 12 months after
that, I worked in a similar role, as a freelancer: working only with clients
and contracting for other agencies, along with a brief stint of
guest-lecturing at the local University. Although the work was mostly the
same‚ÄîI even inherited a client from my old job‚ÄîI worked a lot less per week.
This is because I didn‚Äôt work a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 9-5, but instead worked 10-4
(roughly). Those hours certainly add up. Because the work was quite steady, I
didn‚Äôt need to do much admin and business development stuff, either. This is a
very valid way of going about freelance and I think it could appeal to someone
who is comfortable working almost like they have a day job. The reason you
work a lot less time like this as a freelancer is simple: no company bullshit.
You are the boss of your own time and I promise you: you will make so much
more of the time you do spend working. Back to flexibility again, because
being freelance gives you _lots_ of that. Although I started working like the
above, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be happy doing just client work alone. I‚Äôve
done agency stuff for so many years now that frankly, even the best client
work doesn‚Äôt give me much satisfaction. I decided at the end of last year that
now was the time to build an education business instead and that‚Äôs where
[Piccalilli](//piccalil.li), the site you are on was born. The reason I
mention this in a section about flexibility is because I‚Äôm very much
transitioning into this new world. I still work for clients, but a lot less
so, so I can build Piccalilli up. Granted, I‚Äôve worked a hell of a lot more
this year than last year, but the hope is by next year, I can work **even
less** than a typical 10-4 day, thanks to the work I‚Äôm doing now. This
transition model works well too because client work pays the bills and it
takes the pressure off getting lots of revenue from a business. I‚Äôm very lucky
that Piccalilli is doing much better than anticipated, so I‚Äôm speeding up that
transition. Because I have the flexibility as a freelancer, that is possible
too. The key is that flexibility completely empowers you to work how **you
want to work**.

## Get comfortable with money

There‚Äôs two parts to focus on here: being comfortable talking about money and being comfortable with your
personal finances. I‚Äôll start with talking about money. You **have** to be
comfortable talking about money with clients. In fact, when a new enquiry
lands in my inbox, **the first thing I do is ask them what their budget is**.
So much time is wasted by being coy about money. A client needs to have a
budget to hire you and let me tell you, if they refuse to tell you what that
budget is, **that‚Äôs a massive red flag**. That refusal could be down to
mistrust on their end, though‚Äîthey might think you‚Äôll use that budget to send
them an over-inflated quote. I‚Äôd tackle that by saying something like this: >
‚ÄúIn order to work out what we can achieve on this project, we really need an
idea of budget. It could just be a ballpark, like ¬£5-10k. Creating an estimate
for you without this knowledge of our limitations would be a futile exercise
because I have no idea what the limits of this engagement are.‚Äù The second
part on this section is your own finances. **You need to know exactly how much
money you need to survive every month**. I have a spreadsheet that tells me
how much money to take out of my business with a combination of fixed and
variable costs. This helps me firstly not get stung by the tax office and
secondly, informs me of how much I need to earn to survive each month. An easy
strategy to start with is try to earn your **current full-time
salary**‚Äîespecially if you are a sole trader (we‚Äôll get to that). It‚Äôs a solid
toe-dip approach into freelance. Moving on from that approach: try to **double
your salary**. This is because building up a buffer will make life a _lot_
easier on a number of fronts. Firstly, it‚Äôs ‚Äúget fucked‚Äù money. What I mean by
that is if a client turns out to be a nightmare, you can tell them to get
fucked, knowing that you have a buffer to support you. This is useful for if
your client turns out to be doing very unethical worth, like [working with
ICE](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/30/20728147/tech-company-ice-contracts-foia-microsoft-palantir-concur-dell),
for example. That empowerment is everything. This leads nicely in to
calculating how much you charge for your work. The first point on this is
**never work for free**. If a client demands free spec work, bin them off and
focus on other new clients instead. I personally charge in 2 week sprints,
usually, unless a project is very short, where I will charge a flat rate. For
contracting work‚Äîsay for an agency‚Äîonly then will I charge a day rate. Sprints
and day rate work normally requires a **minimum commitment** from them. Flat
rate requires at least 50% up-front, which we‚Äôll get more into later. My day
rate is **much higher** than my sprint rate. This is because day rate work
tends to come with more risk, so I account for that by charging more money. It
also reduces my ability to schedule efficiently, because this sort of work can
drag on much longer than anticipated, so again, the client is going to pay for
that disruption. In terms of how much to charge: this comes down to knowing
how much you need. Get your monthly outgoings spreadsheet, take the total and
**triple it**. ‚ÄúWhy the hell?!?‚Äù, they scream. We triple it because there‚Äôs a
darn good chance you will experience **very quiet spells**, so charging a lot
more for your work when you have it builds up your buffer to get you through
these times. You get more ammo to tell awful clients to fuck off, and getting
to that goal of doubling your full-time salary gets easier.

## Get good at

organising your time Those who know me well, know that I organise everything
to within an inch of its life. I do all of this organising in
[Notion](https://www.notion.so) and
[Things](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743). Notion is the
main hub of planning, scheduling and client communications (yep, you read that
right). Things is what I use to manage my tasks. I did previously do this in
Notion and before that, in a bullet journal, but now, Notion is the main
bullet journal and Things does its job well for me.

    tasks](https://piccalilli.imgix.net/images/blog/freelance/freelance-1.jpg?format=auto&q=60&w=1500)

    <figcaption class="measure-medium text-400">
      I prioritise my tasks with üö® P1 and üî• P2, with the rest being optional
      for the day.
    </figcaption>

  </figure>

I‚Äôm not going to tell you how to plan and organise in this post. Maybe I will
go into more detail if there‚Äôs an appetite for it, but the main theme is
however you want to do it, just do it. Being disorganised, when you are your
own boss will surely be a disaster and even having a notepad with a todo list
on it is better than nothing. I strongly recommend that you schedule what you
are working on each day in advance. I‚Äôd still give yourself a bit of
flexibility because you might not be in the mood to say, do some creative work
once you wake up, but planning time in advance is really helpful not just to
keep track of where your projects are, but also where your next availability
is, which segues us nicely to the next section.

    Roadmapping your time like this is super helpful to get an idea of what‚Äôs
    coming up and where you can squeeze clients in.
  </figcaption>

  </figure>

## Don‚Äôt wait to find work Now that you are super organised, you‚Äôll know on

your schedule where the gaps are. Don‚Äôt wait to fill them: start putting
feelers out for projects immediately. If I see a gap that I want to fill come
up, I send out a tweet along the lines of this: > I‚Äôve got a bit of
availability coming up, so if you need some design or front-end development
work, give me a shout and we‚Äôll get it booked in! I keep the timing vague
because all I‚Äôm doing here is gathering a couple of leads. The tweets will
often lead to nothing, but it does plant the idea that you have availability
in people‚Äôs heads. If someone knows of work coming up a month later, they
might think: ‚ÄúOh, I saw Andy had availability coming up. I should recommend
them‚Äù. Being organised with this stuff gives you flexibility for this sort of
chance recommendation to happen. If you wait right until the last minute to
land work, there‚Äôs a good chance that your tweet/instagram/mailshot will land
nothing and you will go into panic mode (unless you have a large buffer). This
is often when you‚Äôll snatch at a project and land a nightmare client. I won‚Äôt
tell you where to find work because that varies a lot, but my advice is to
network in your industry and get to know people. Building a reputation is so
important because people will recommend you to potential new clients if you‚Äôre
a pleasure to work with and do a good job. I get most of my client work via a
recommendation from someone else now. That doesn‚Äôt fix the problem of how to
land that first project, though. I think for that, tweeting that you‚Äôre going
freelance (I‚Äôll always RT if you send me the tweet) and alerting people in
your network will probably get you that first freelance job.

## Contracts, insurance and deposits

Contracts and insurance are so important. Insurance
especially so if you‚Äôre not going to incorporate as a company (still get
insurance if you do). I have insurance with [With
Jack](https://withjack.co.uk), who are fantastic. Basically, if I mess up, I
won‚Äôt get ruined because I have insurance. If you are writing code for
clients, **please insure yourself**, because at some point, you probably will
mess up. Contracts achieve two things in my experience. They build trust
between client and vendor (that's you). A contract could be really simple,
like [Andy Clarke‚Äôs Contract
Killer](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer). I would
recommend getting something a bit more bulletproof for very large projects
though. This is where I would turn to a legal professional. Lastly, **get at
least 50% of your project budget up-front** if you are charging a flat rate
and if not, get some form of deposit. There are only a _tiny_ handful of
clients that I won‚Äôt take a deposit off, only because I trust them a lot.
Normally, that deposit has to be in my bank before I even lift a finger
because if the client suddenly decides they are going to be bad payers (it
happens a lot unfortunately), you have a good chunk of money still. Remember
when I said charge 3X what you need? You‚Äôd be pretty thankful for that right
now if it all goes pear shaped.

## Incorporate or don‚Äôt I run my freelance

business as a Limited Company. I didn‚Äôt technically need to do that, but the
main reason I do is _liability_. It also gives me flexibility. Those who have
purchased content on this site (thank you) will have probably noticed that you
pay my limited company, Andy Bell Design Ltd which _trades_ as Piccalilli. If
you get good insurance (use [With Jack](https://withjack.co.uk), seriously),
then running as a Sole Trader is more than fine. When I first started out in
the industry, it‚Äôs what I did and it was fine. Just be aware that some
corporate clients don‚Äôt like working with Sole Traders, so being a Limited
Company can be useful for that too. Get a good accountant regardless. I can‚Äôt
stress enough how a good accountant is your most important expense. In fact, a
good accountant will most likely **pay for themselves**. It‚Äôs all well and
good using fancy accounting tools, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty
of tax returns‚Äîespecially self-assessment‚Äîa good accountant will make that
process so much easier and most likely cheaper. They also very often give
_fantastic_ business advice. Please, for the love of everything, don‚Äôt try to
run a Limited Company without one **especially** if you are VAT registered.
Make sure you get a separate bank account, too. I use [Monzo
business](https://monzo.com/i/business).

## Get good at communication The last

part of this post is a tip on communication. Get good at emailing. I know I
run most stuff through Notion, but the same principles apply, even in there.
Short, concise communication is the best way: trust me. I‚Äôll be _extremely
opinionated_ on this because being concise (often blunt) works very well for
me. When I write an email, it‚Äôs extremely short and to the point and will very
likely feature bullet points. It has to be readable in less than a minute.
This means that you should probably remove pleasantries such as the infamous
‚ÄúI hope you are well‚Äù or worse: ‚ÄúI hope this email reaches you well‚Äù‚Äîwritten
as if the email was delivered by a donkey, via a mountain range... The reason
to keep things short is that **people are busy**. You might feel like you are
being polite, riddling a email with pleasantries, but really, you‚Äôre probably
being the opposite, taking up their time. If I see a wall of text in my inbox,
I‚Äôll set it aside until I can be arsed reading it, which in a lot of cases, is
never. Getting good at writing short emails is something that happens over
time though, so get practicing now! Lastly, meetings are a time-sink. I often
joke that I am a professional meeting-dodger because I _hate them_. Granted,
some things require a meeting, but most stuff can be done with written
communication. I actually like to record screen-casts, which you can [read up
on
here](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/screencasting-the-secret-sauce-for-less-time-wasted-in-meetings/).
Also, don‚Äôt join your client‚Äôs Slack: they aren‚Äôt paying you for 24/7
support!!

## Wrapping up It‚Äôs worth noting that this post is written by me, a

CIS white guy from the UK. I couldn‚Äôt be more privileged if I tried, so take
my advice with a pinch of salt. I do hope it has been useful, though. If you
are thinking of going freelance: **do it**. I believe in you! Going freelance
was **by far** the best decision I ever made. I did it at a very stressful
time‚Äîshortly after being made redundant‚Äîbut now, it would take _a hell of a
lot_ for me to even consider working for a company again. Take it easy and
good luck if this is the start of your freelancing career üôÇ \* \* \* This is a
