# Carrot CSS

**Carrot CSS** is a CSS Starter or _micro-framework_, it is not a framework as it does and assume way less, but this is more than a reset, as it give you a sane boilerplate for you to write your own CSS code.

[To know more please refer to the documentation](https://tomquinonero.github.io/carrot-css/)

## Why Carrot CSS ?

Carrot CSS is a stable foundation for your projects, it is lightweight and CSS only. It use CSS variables and have built-in theme support, and the whole thing is understandable and easily customizable.
And also, _Carrot CSS don't go too far_, it only weight `4.2kB` gzipped and does just what you need, no more.

This library should be used by people that actually intend to write CSS, as it is not a component library, does not offers much styling and is not an utility library.
This is not meant to stops you from writing CSS, but to start your CSS from a right basis.

## Features

- **Style Reboot**: A reset and some base style for elements
- **Sane base**: Gets the font right, well named variables and theming support
- **Utilities**: A great color palette, some layout utilities and button styles
